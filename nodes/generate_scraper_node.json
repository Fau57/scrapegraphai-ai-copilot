    {
        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the GenerateScraperNode class?",
        "answer": "The `GenerateScraperNode` class generates a python script for scraping a website using the specified library. It takes the user's prompt and the scraped content as input and generates a python script that extracts the information requested by the user."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What are the attributes of the GenerateScraperNode class?",
        "answer": "The `GenerateScraperNode` class has three main attributes: `llm_model`, an instance of a language model client configured for generating answers; `library`, the python library to use for scraping the website; and `source`, the website to scrape."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What does the __init__ method do in the GenerateScraperNode class?",
        "answer": "The `__init__` method in the `GenerateScraperNode` class initializes the node with a unique identifier name, input and output keys, and additional configuration for the node. It also sets the `llm_model`, `library`, and `source` attributes."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What does the execute method do in the GenerateScraperNode class?",
        "answer": "The `execute` method in the `GenerateScraperNode` class generates a python script for scraping a website using the specified library. It returns the updated state with the output key containing the generated python script."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What happens if GenerateScraperNode is given more than 1 context chunk?",
        "answer": "If `GenerateScraperNode` is given more than 1 context chunk, it raises a `NotImplementedError`, as it currently cannot handle more than 1 context chunk."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the role of the language model in GenerateScraperNode?",
        "answer": "The language model in GenerateScraperNode is responsible for generating a python script for scraping a website using the specified library. It receives a prompt constructed from the user's question, the scraped content, and the specified library, and generates a python script that extracts the requested information."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What happens if the specified library is not supported by GenerateScraperNode?",
        "answer": "If the specified library is not supported by GenerateScraperNode, it is up to the language model to handle the situation. The language model may generate an error message or attempt to generate a python script using a different library."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the StrOutputParser class in GenerateScraperNode?",
        "answer": "The StrOutputParser class in GenerateScraperNode is responsible for parsing the output of the language model. It takes the output of the language model and extracts the generated python script."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the template variable in GenerateScraperNode?",
        "answer": "The template variable in GenerateScraperNode is used to construct a prompt for the language model. It contains a string that specifies the format of the prompt, including placeholders for the user's question, the scraped content, and the specified library."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the input_keys variable in GenerateScraperNode?",
        "answer": "The input_keys variable in GenerateScraperNode is used to specify the input keys needed from the state. It contains a boolean expression that defines the input keys required by the node."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the output variable in GenerateScraperNode?",
        "answer": "The output variable in GenerateScraperNode is used to specify the output keys to be updated in the state. It contains a list of strings that define the output keys of the node."
    },
