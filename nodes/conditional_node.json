      "prompt": "What is the purpose of the ConditionalNode class in ScrapeGraphAI?",
      "answer": "The `ConditionalNode` class is a node that determines the next step in the graph's execution flow based on the presence and content of a specified key in the graph's state. It extends the BaseNode class by adding condition-based logic to the execution process."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the attributes of the ConditionalNode class in ScrapeGraphAI?",
      "answer": "The attribute of the `ConditionalNode` class is `key_name`, which is the name of the key in the state to check for its presence."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What is the role of the key_name attribute in the ConditionalNode class in ScrapeGraphAI?",
      "answer": "The `key_name` attribute is the name of the key to check in the graph's state. This is used to determine the path the graph's execution should take."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the methods of the ConditionalNode class in ScrapeGraphAI?",
      "answer": "The methods of the `ConditionalNode` class are `__init__` and `execute`."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "In ScrapeGraphAI, what is the purpose of the __init__ method in the ConditionalNode class?",
      "answer": "The `__init__` method is the constructor method for initializing the `ConditionalNode` class with the required attributes, such as key_name and node_name."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What is the purpose of the execute method in the ConditionalNode class of ScrapeGraphAI?",
      "answer": "The `execute` method is responsible for checking if the specified key is present in the state and deciding the next node accordingly. It returns the name of the next node to execute based on the presence of the key."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What class does the ScrapeGraphAI ConditionalNode inherit from?",
        "answer": "The `ConditionalNode` inherits from the `BaseNode`."
    },
