        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the GenerateScraperNode class in Scrapegraph AI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the `GenerateScraperNode` class is to generate a Python script for scraping a website using the specified library. It takes the user's prompt and the scraped content as input and generates a Python script that extracts the information requested by the user."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What are the attributes of the GenerateScraperNode class in Scrapegraph AI?",
        "answer": "The `GenerateScraperNode` class has three attributes: `llm_model`, which is an instance of a language model client configured for generating answers, `library`, which is the Python library to use for scraping the website, and `source`, which is the website to scrape."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What does the execute method of the GenerateScraperNode class do in Scrapegraph AI??",
        "answer": "The `execute` method of the `GenerateScraperNode` class generates a Python script for scraping a website using the specified library. It first fetches the user's prompt and the scraped content from the state, then constructs a prompt using the specified library and the scraped content, and finally feeds the prompt to the language model and parses its response to generate the Python script."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What happens if the input keys are not found in the state passed to the execute method of the GenerateScraperNode class in Scrapegraph AI??",
        "answer": "If the input keys are not found in the state passed to the `execute` method of the `GenerateScraperNode` class, a `KeyError` is raised, indicating that the necessary information for generating the Python script is missing."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the role of the RunnableParallel class in the GenerateScraperNode class in Scrapegraph AI??",
        "answer": "The `RunnableParallel` class is not used in the provided `GenerateScraperNode` code."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the StrOutputParser class in the GenerateScraperNode class in Scrapegraph AI??",
        "answer": "The `StrOutputParser` class is used in the `GenerateScraperNode` class to parse the response of the language model and extract the generated Python script in the correct format."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Can the GenerateScraperNode class handle more than one context chunk in Scrapegraph AI??",
        "answer": "No, the `GenerateScraperNode` class cannot handle more than one context chunk. If it encounters more than one context chunk, it raises a NotImplementedError."
