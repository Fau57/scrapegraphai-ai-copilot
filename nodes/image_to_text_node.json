        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the ImageToTextNode class in Scrapegraph AI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the `ImageToTextNode` class in Scrapegraph AI is to retrieve images from a list of URLs and return a description of the images using an image-to-text model."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What are the attributes of the ImageToTextNode class in Scrapegraph AI?",
        "answer": "The `ImageToTextNode` class in Scrapegraph AI has three attributes: `llm_model`, which is an instance of the language model client used for image-to-text conversion, `verbose`, which is a boolean flag indicating whether to show print statements during execution, and `max_images`, which is the maximum number of images to be processed."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What does the execute method of the ImageToTextNode class in Scrapegraph AI do?",
        "answer": "The `execute` method of the `ImageToTextNode` class in Scrapegraph AI generates text from an image using an image-to-text model. The method retrieves the image from the list of URLs provided in the state and returns the extracted text."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What happens if the input keys are not found in the state passed to the execute method of the ImageToTextNode class in Scrapegraph AI?",
        "answer": "If the input keys are not found in the state passed to the `execute` method of the `ImageToTextNode` class in Scrapegraph AI, the method will not be able to retrieve the list of URLs, and the state will not be updated with the extracted text."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the max_images attribute in the ImageToTextNode class in Scrapegraph AI?",
        "answer": "The `max_images` attribute in the `ImageToTextNode` class in Scrapegraph AI is used to limit the number of images to be processed by the image-to-text model."
