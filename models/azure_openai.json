        "prompt": "In Scrapegraph-ai, what is the purpose of the __init__ method in the following Python class: class AzureOpenAI(AzureChatOpenAI): def __init__(self, llm_config: dict)",
        "answer": "The __init__ method in the AzureOpenAI class is a constructor. It is called when an object is created from the class and allows the class to initialize the object's attributes. In this case, it is used to initialize the 'llm_config' attribute of 'AzureOpenAI' objects with the provided dictionary of configuration parameters."

        "prompt": "In Scrapegraph-ai, how would you create an instance of the following Python class: class AzureOpenAI(AzureChatOpenAI): def __init__(self, llm_config: dict)",
        "answer": "You can create an instance of the AzureOpenAI class by calling the class with the necessary arguments for the __init__ method. In this case, you would need to provide a dictionary of configuration parameters for the 'llm_config' attribute. For example: 'my_instance = AzureOpenAI({'param1': 'value1', 'param2': 'value2'})'."
