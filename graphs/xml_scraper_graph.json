        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the XMLScraperGraph class in scrapegraph ai?",
        "answer": "The `XMLScraperGraph` class in scrapegraph ai is a scraping pipeline that extracts information from XML files using a natural language model to interpret and answer prompts."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What are the main attributes of the XMLScraperGraph class in scrapegraph ai?",
        "answer": "The main attributes of the `XMLScraperGraph` class in scrapegraph ai are inherited from the `AbstractGraph` class, such as `prompt`, `config`, `source`, and `schema`. Additionally, it has the `input_key` attribute, which is either 'xml' or 'xml_dir' based on the source."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the role of the _create_graph method in the XMLScraperGraph class of scrapegraph ai?",
        "answer": "The `_create_graph` method in the `XMLScraperGraph` class of scrapegraph ai is responsible for creating the graph of nodes representing the workflow for XML scraping. It includes nodes for fetching the XML data, processing it with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model, and generating the final answer with the GenerateAnswerNode."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What does the run method in the XMLScraperGraph class of scrapegraph ai do?",
        "answer": "The `run` method in the `XMLScraperGraph` class of scrapegraph ai executes the XML scraping process by providing the initial inputs to the graph and calling the graph's execute method. It then stores the final state and execution info and returns the answer to the prompt."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "How does the XMLScraperGraph class in scrapegraph ai handle XML files and directories?",
        "answer": "The `XMLScraperGraph` class in scrapegraph ai determines the `input_key` attribute based on the source. If the source ends with 'xml', the `input_key` is set to 'xml', and if not, it is set to 'xml_dir'. This `input_key` is then used to provide the correct input to the graph's fetch node."
