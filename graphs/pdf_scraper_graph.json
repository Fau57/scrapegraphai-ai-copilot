        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the PDFScraperGraph class?",
        "answer": "The `PDFScraperGraph` class is a scraping pipeline that extracts information from pdf files using a natural language model to interpret and answer prompts. It provides a common set of methods and attributes for pdf scraping and allows users to define their own pdf scraping graphs by inheriting from it and implementing the required methods."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What are the attributes of the PDFScraperGraph class?",
        "answer": "The `PDFScraperGraph` class has several attributes, including `prompt` (the prompt for the graph), `source` (the source of the graph), `config` (configuration parameters for the graph), `schema` (the schema for the graph output), `llm_model` (an instance of a language model client), `embedder_model` (an instance of an embedding model client), `verbose` (a flag indicating whether to show print statements during execution), and `headless` (a flag indicating whether to run the graph in headless mode)."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the _create_graph method in the PDFScraperGraph class?",
        "answer": "The `_create_graph` method in the `PDFScraperGraph` class is used to create a graph representation for pdf scraping. It takes no arguments and returns an instance of the `BaseGraph` class, which contains a set of nodes and edges that define the pdf scraping workflow."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the purpose of the run method in the PDFScraperGraph class?",
        "answer": "The `run` method in the `PDFScraperGraph` class is used to execute the pdf scraping process and return the answer to the prompt. It takes no arguments and returns a string containing the answer to the prompt."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What are the nodes in the PDFScraperGraph graph?",
        "answer": "The nodes in the `PDFScraperGraph` graph are `FetchNode`, `RAGNode`, and `GenerateAnswerPDFNode`. The `FetchNode` node is responsible for fetching the pdf file or directory of pdf files. The `RAGNode` node is responsible for extracting relevant chunks of text from the pdf file(s) using a natural language model. The `GenerateAnswerPDFNode` node is responsible for generating an answer to the prompt based on the extracted text."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the input and output of each node in the PDFScraperGraph graph?",
        "answer": "The input of the `FetchNode` node is `'pdf | pdf_dir'` and its output is `['doc']`. The input of the `RAGNode` node is `'user_prompt & doc'` and its output is `['relevant_chunks']`. The input of the `GenerateAnswerPDFNode` node is `'user_prompt & (relevant_chunks | doc)'` and its output is `['answer']`."
