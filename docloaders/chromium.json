      "prompt": "In scrapegraph ai, what are the attributes of the ChromiumLoader class?",
      "answer": "The attributes of the `ChromiumLoader` class in scrapegraph ai are `backend` (the web driver backend library; defaults to 'playwright'), `browser_config` (a dictionary containing additional browser kwargs), `headless` (whether to run browser in headless mode), `proxy` (a dictionary containing proxy settings; None disables protection), and `urls` (a list of URLs to scrape content from)."

      "prompt": "In scrapegraph ai, what are the methods of the ChromiumLoader class?",
      "answer": "The methods of the `ChromiumLoader` class in scrapegraph ai are `__init__` (initializes the loader with a list of URL paths), `ascrape_playwright` (asynchronously scrapes the content of a given URL using Playwright's async API), `lazy_load` (lazily loads text content from the provided URLs), and `alazy_load` (asynchronously loads text content from the provided URLs)."

      "answer": "The `lazy_load` method in the `ChromiumLoader` class of scrapegraph ai lazily loads text content from the provided URLs. This method yields Documents one at a time as they're scraped, instead of waiting to scrape all URLs before returning."

    {
      "prompt": "In scrapegraph ai, what is the purpose of the `alazy_load` method in the ChromiumLoader class?",
      "answer": "The `alazy_load` method in the `ChromiumLoader` class of scrapegraph ai asynchronously loads text content from the provided URLs. This method leverages asyncio to initiate the scraping of all provided URLs simultaneously. It improves performance by utilizing concurrent asynchronous requests. Each Document is yielded as soon as its content is available, encapsulating the scraped content."
